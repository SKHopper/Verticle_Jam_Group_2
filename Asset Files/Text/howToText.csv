basic,"You are a bee, and your goal is to have enough Honey in your Hive for the winter.
Your Hive makes Honey after you deposite Nectar, which is gained passively 
from touching flowering Native plants.
Plants also give you pollen, which can pollinate other plants to grow automatically
from seeds. Red-pollen Invasive plants will not give Nectar and may have other
bad effects.
While some Native animals are helpful, Invasive animals may steal Honey from
your Hive, destroy plantlife, or attack you. You can sting these animals freely, but
if you are attacked too many times you will have to respawn using Honey."
